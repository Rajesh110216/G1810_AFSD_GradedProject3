In Eclipse, set up your Spring Boot project, define your Model classes and data access components, create Controller classes to handle web requests, and develop the Views for user interaction. Spring Boot simplifies many aspects of web application development, such as configuration and dependency management, making it a popular choice for building CRUD applications.

A Spring Boot-based MVC CRUD Ticket Tracker application in Eclipse provides a structured way to manage and track tickets, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete ticket records through a user-friendly web interface.
